# MathProblem
This program attempts to find ALL (so no random guessing) solutions to this problem in a more efficient manner than simply going through all possible numbers between 0 and 1 billion::: Rule: the 9 numbers (n1-n9) cannot repeat each other. Find the solutions to this equation: (n1/n2*n3+n4*n5*n6/n7+n8*n9)=100
